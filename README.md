## Toobin' Mayhem

### Description

Toobin' Mayhem is my submission for the Raylib Slo-Jam. Based on Toobin' arcade game and Asteroids arcade game.

It is my first little project in C and in Raylib, so it was a big struggle. Source code is a mess because I had to finish it before the 8th of January 2024, but I managed to do it and I am proud of that!

Play with the ARROW keys and CTRL to shoot. Shoot the driftwood as soon as possible, because hitting it will cause instant exploding of your floating tube ending in a GAME OVER. Shoot the rubber ducks to gain point. Be aware that these ducks are kamikaze ducks and they will explode next to you or even hide under your tube before exploding. Exploding will decrease your score with 2 points, but shooting a duck increases the score with 10 points.

Time, exploding ducks and hitting the boardwalk will decrease the air in your tube.
